# Knowledge Author Prompt

You are writing one draft Knowledge Object for a knowledge-first IT learning platform.

You are not doing Transcript Intelligence. You are not doing Discovery Review. Those stages are already complete. Your job is to author one reviewable draft Knowledge Object from the approved concept below.

## Source Files
- normalizedDiscoveryReview: data/imports/reviewed/03-installing-operating-systems-discovery-review.json
- transcriptIntelligence: data/imports/pending/03-transcript-intelligence.json

## Approved Concept
- conceptId: DISC-001
- proposedKnowledgeId: os-installation.bootable-usb
- title: Bootable USB operating system installation
- type: tool
- domains: operating-systems, storage
- priority: normal
- recommendedDepth: brief
- reason: Bootable USB media is a practical OS installation method with enough source support to author as a focused install-media concept.

## Discovery Review Requirements
Must cover:
- purpose of bootable USB media
- need for firmware/boot-order support
- common use during OS installation

Merge guidance to preserve:
- No merge guidance targets this object.

Relevant gap review:
- GAP-001: Create or link a boot process/boot order prerequisite concept. (The installation lesson assumes boot process and firmware boot-order basics.)

## Source Evidence From Transcript Intelligence
- EVID-001: "One common method is to use a bootable USB drive." — Introduces bootable USB media as an OS installation method.

## Suggested Relationships From Discovery
Prerequisites:
- None suggested.

Relationships:
- None suggested.

Curriculum placement:
- a-plus-220-1202 → 1.0 → operating-system-foundations: Bootable USB operating system installation is part of operating system installation foundations.

## Required Output
Return JSON only. No markdown around the JSON.

Return exactly one draft Knowledge Object using this schema shape:

## Authoring Rules
- Use the approved concept ID exactly: os-installation.bootable-usb
- Keep status as needs-review.
- Do not include private transcript or video provenance in sources. Public JSON allows sources.references only.
- Do not invent exact exam objective numbers beyond the supplied section unless clearly supported.
- Preserve source-supported facts separately in reviewNotes when needed.
- Add reviewNotes for any enriched content that was not directly supported by source evidence.
- Do not create quiz questions. Add examTips, commonMistakes, scenarios, pbqIdeas, and questionTargets only as seeds.
- Keep the object reusable and certification-agnostic even though it is mapped to A+.
- Avoid duplicating concepts that Discovery Review marked for merge.
