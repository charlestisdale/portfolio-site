# Knowledge Author Prompt

You are writing one draft Knowledge Object for a knowledge-first IT learning platform.

You are not doing Transcript Intelligence. You are not doing Discovery Review. Those stages are already complete. Your job is to author one reviewable draft Knowledge Object from the approved concept below.

## Source Files
- normalizedDiscoveryReview: data/imports/reviewed/02-file-systems-discovery-review.json
- transcriptIntelligence: data/imports/pending/02-transcript-intelligence.json

## Approved Concept
- conceptId: DISC-009
- proposedKnowledgeId: filesystems.xfs
- title: XFS
- type: file-system
- domains: filesystems, linux, server
- priority: high
- recommendedDepth: normal
- reason: Valid Linux high-performance/data-center file-system concept.

## Discovery Review Requirements
Must cover:
- Use the approved concept and source evidence to determine essential coverage.

Merge guidance to preserve:
- No merge guidance targets this object.

Relevant gap review:
- No specific gap review targets this object.

## Source Evidence From Transcript Intelligence
- EVID-019: "This would be the extended file system or XFS." — Introduces XFS in Linux data-center context.
- EVID-020: "XFS supports a very large file system size so we can store massive amounts of data on these systems." — Gives scalability purpose.
- EVID-021: "This also includes journaling which helps minimize any cases of corruption if any of this reading or writing of data happens to be interrupted." — Introduces journaling and corruption protection.
- EVID-022: "XFS also has a minimum amount of fragmentation." — Adds performance/fragmentation feature.

## Suggested Relationships From Discovery
Prerequisites:
- operatingsystems.linux: XFS is introduced as a Linux file system.
- storage.data-integrity: Journaling is linked to minimizing corruption.

Relationships:
- used_for: filesystems.journaling — The source says XFS includes journaling to reduce corruption from interrupted writes.
- related_to: filesystems.fragmentation — The source links XFS with low fragmentation and performance.
- contrasts_with: filesystems.ext4 — Both are Linux file systems, but XFS is emphasized for high-performance/data-center workloads.

Curriculum placement:
- a-plus-220-1202 → 1.0 → file-systems: Belongs in the file-systems module because it is directly taught as part of the lesson’s file-system comparison.

## Required Output
Return JSON only. No markdown around the JSON.

Return exactly one draft Knowledge Object using this schema shape:

## Authoring Rules
- Use the approved concept ID exactly: filesystems.xfs
- Keep status as needs-review.
- Do not include private transcript or video provenance in sources. Public JSON allows sources.references only.
- Do not invent exact exam objective numbers beyond the supplied section unless clearly supported.
- Preserve source-supported facts separately in reviewNotes when needed.
- Add reviewNotes for any enriched content that was not directly supported by source evidence.
- Do not create quiz questions. Add examTips, commonMistakes, scenarios, pbqIdeas, and questionTargets only as seeds.
- Keep the object reusable and certification-agnostic even though it is mapped to A+.
- Avoid duplicating concepts that Discovery Review marked for merge.
