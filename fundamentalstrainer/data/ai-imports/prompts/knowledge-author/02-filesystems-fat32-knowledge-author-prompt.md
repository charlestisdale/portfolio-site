# Knowledge Author Prompt

You are writing one draft Knowledge Object for a knowledge-first IT learning platform.

You are not doing Transcript Intelligence. You are not doing Discovery Review. Those stages are already complete. Your job is to author one reviewable draft Knowledge Object from the approved concept below.

## Source Files
- normalizedDiscoveryReview: data/imports/reviewed/02-file-systems-discovery-review.json
- transcriptIntelligence: data/imports/pending/02-transcript-intelligence.json

## Approved Concept
- conceptId: DISC-006
- proposedKnowledgeId: filesystems.fat32
- title: FAT32
- type: file-system
- domains: filesystems
- priority: high
- recommendedDepth: normal
- reason: Exam-relevant limits and compatibility justify authoring.

## Discovery Review Requirements
Must cover:
- Use the approved concept and source evidence to determine essential coverage.

Merge guidance to preserve:
- No merge guidance targets this object.

Relevant gap review:
- No specific gap review targets this object.

## Source Evidence From Transcript Intelligence
- EVID-012: "A file system that's been around for a very long time and one that has supported many different operating systems is the file allocation table or FAT." — Introduces FAT family and compatibility.
- EVID-013: "FAT32 allows you to have volume sizes of 2 terb with a maximum file size of 4 GB in that partition." — Gives limits that are exam-relevant.

## Suggested Relationships From Discovery
Prerequisites:
- filesystems.file-system: FAT32 is a file-system example.

Relationships:
- contrasts_with: filesystems.exfat — exFAT is described as overcoming FAT32 file-size limitations.
- contrasts_with: filesystems.ntfs — NTFS is described as an upgrade to FAT32.

Curriculum placement:
- a-plus-220-1202 → 1.0 → file-systems: Belongs in the file-systems module because it is directly taught as part of the lesson’s file-system comparison.

## Required Output
Return JSON only. No markdown around the JSON.

Return exactly one draft Knowledge Object using this schema shape:

## Authoring Rules
- Use the approved concept ID exactly: filesystems.fat32
- Keep status as needs-review.
- Do not include private transcript or video provenance in sources. Public JSON allows sources.references only.
- Do not invent exact exam objective numbers beyond the supplied section unless clearly supported.
- Preserve source-supported facts separately in reviewNotes when needed.
- Add reviewNotes for any enriched content that was not directly supported by source evidence.
- Do not create quiz questions. Add examTips, commonMistakes, scenarios, pbqIdeas, and questionTargets only as seeds.
- Keep the object reusable and certification-agnostic even though it is mapped to A+.
- Avoid duplicating concepts that Discovery Review marked for merge.
