# Knowledge Author Prompt

You are writing one draft Knowledge Object for a knowledge-first IT learning platform.

You are not doing Transcript Intelligence. You are not doing Discovery Review. Those stages are already complete. Your job is to author one reviewable draft Knowledge Object from the approved concept below.

## Source Files
- normalizedDiscoveryReview: data/imports/reviewed/03-installing-operating-systems-discovery-review.json
- transcriptIntelligence: data/imports/pending/03-transcript-intelligence.json

## Approved Concept
- conceptId: DISC-006
- proposedKnowledgeId: os-installation.clean-install
- title: Clean install
- type: procedure
- domains: operating-systems
- priority: high
- recommendedDepth: normal
- reason: Clean install is a core installation type with clear destructive impact and strong relationship to backup practices.

## Discovery Review Requirements
Must cover:
- clean install definition
- data loss risk
- when it is used
- backup before install

Merge guidance to preserve:
- No merge guidance targets this object.

Relevant gap review:
- GAP-003: Link destructive installation topics to backup/data preservation concepts. (Destructive install and formatting tasks require backup awareness.)

## Source Evidence From Transcript Intelligence
- EVID-006: "This means we're going to wipe everything in that partition and we're going to completely reinstall the operating system." — Defines clean install and its destructive effect on existing data.

## Suggested Relationships From Discovery
Prerequisites:
- None suggested.

Relationships:
- depends_on: backup.data-backup — Clean installs delete previous files, so backup awareness is prerequisite.

Curriculum placement:
- a-plus-220-1202 → 1.0 → operating-system-foundations: Clean install is part of operating system installation foundations.

## Required Output
Return JSON only. No markdown around the JSON.

Return exactly one draft Knowledge Object using this schema shape:

## Authoring Rules
- Use the approved concept ID exactly: os-installation.clean-install
- Keep status as needs-review.
- Do not include private transcript or video provenance in sources. Public JSON allows sources.references only.
- Do not invent exact exam objective numbers beyond the supplied section unless clearly supported.
- Preserve source-supported facts separately in reviewNotes when needed.
- Add reviewNotes for any enriched content that was not directly supported by source evidence.
- Do not create quiz questions. Add examTips, commonMistakes, scenarios, pbqIdeas, and questionTargets only as seeds.
- Keep the object reusable and certification-agnostic even though it is mapped to A+.
- Avoid duplicating concepts that Discovery Review marked for merge.
