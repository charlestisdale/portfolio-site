# Knowledge Author Prompt

You are writing one draft Knowledge Object for a knowledge-first IT learning platform.

You are not doing Transcript Intelligence. You are not doing Discovery Review. Those stages are already complete. Your job is to author one reviewable draft Knowledge Object from the approved concept below.

## Source Files
- normalizedDiscoveryReview: data/imports/reviewed/03-installing-operating-systems-discovery-review.json
- transcriptIntelligence: data/imports/pending/03-transcript-intelligence.json

## Approved Concept
- conceptId: DISC-013
- proposedKnowledgeId: os-installation.third-party-driver-loading
- title: Third-party driver loading during OS installation
- type: procedure
- domains: operating-systems, hardware
- priority: normal
- recommendedDepth: brief
- reason: The lesson provides a clear use case: installer lacks storage or network drivers, requiring third-party driver loading.

## Discovery Review Requirements
Must cover:
- installer may not recognize hardware
- storage/network driver examples
- driver prompt during installation

Merge guidance to preserve:
- No merge guidance targets this object.

Relevant gap review:
- No specific gap review targets this object.

## Source Evidence From Transcript Intelligence
- EVID-013: "you may have to load third-party drivers to connect to a storage device or to a network connection" — Explains why installer drivers may be required.

## Suggested Relationships From Discovery
Prerequisites:
- None suggested.

Relationships:
- depends_on: hardware.device-driver — This concept depends on understanding device drivers.

Curriculum placement:
- a-plus-220-1202 → 1.0 → operating-system-foundations: Third-party driver loading during OS installation is part of operating system installation foundations.

## Required Output
Return JSON only. No markdown around the JSON.

Return exactly one draft Knowledge Object using this schema shape:

## Authoring Rules
- Use the approved concept ID exactly: os-installation.third-party-driver-loading
- Keep status as needs-review.
- Do not include private transcript or video provenance in sources. Public JSON allows sources.references only.
- Do not invent exact exam objective numbers beyond the supplied section unless clearly supported.
- Preserve source-supported facts separately in reviewNotes when needed.
- Add reviewNotes for any enriched content that was not directly supported by source evidence.
- Do not create quiz questions. Add examTips, commonMistakes, scenarios, pbqIdeas, and questionTargets only as seeds.
- Keep the object reusable and certification-agnostic even though it is mapped to A+.
- Avoid duplicating concepts that Discovery Review marked for merge.
